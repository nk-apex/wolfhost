Second Security Scan Results for host.xwolf.space

The critical vulnerability from last time is NOT fixed. Here's the full breakdown:

CRITICAL - Still Open (from last scan):

1. /api/servers leaks ALL user data without authentication
Still completely wide open. I pulled server details for users 1-50 again. No login required. Server names, UUIDs, IP addresses/ports, plans, and resource usage are all visible to anyone.

NEW CRITICAL FINDINGS:

2. Automated mass account creation - no CAPTCHA, no email verification
I just created 3 fake accounts on your platform in seconds via a simple API call:

securitytest123 (user ID 179)
securitytest456 (user ID 180)
securitytest789 (user ID 181)
No CAPTCHA, no email verification, no rate limiting on registration. An attacker could create thousands of accounts automatically. Each account also auto-provisions a free trial server, which means someone could flood your infrastructure.

3. Registration auto-provisions servers with no verification
When I registered as securitytest123, the system automatically created a server: securitytest123-welcome-trial with 1GB RAM and 5GB storage. An attacker mass-creating accounts could exhaust your node resources.

4. Logged-in users can still view OTHER users' servers
Even after logging in, I was able to query userId=1 to see your (the admin's) servers. The API doesn't check if the requesting user matches the userId being queried.

5. Sequential user IDs make enumeration trivial
User IDs are still simple integers (1, 2, 3...). I found servers for user IDs: 1, 2, 4, 5, 20, 24, 25, 34, 40, 48, 49. That's your entire customer base mapped out in seconds.

WHAT'S GOOD (unchanged or improved):

Admin endpoints are properly protected ("Admin access required")
Sensitive file paths (.env, .git, config) return 404
Strong security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
Login endpoint has rate limiting (10 requests per 15 min)
DELETE/PUT/POST on servers endpoint are blocked
Privilege escalation attempts failed (can't make yourself admin)
HTTPS enforced, good referrer policy
Priority fixes I'd recommend:

Add authentication to /api/servers - Require a valid session and only return the logged-in user's servers
Add CAPTCHA to registration - Prevents bot account creation
Add email verification - Don't activate accounts until email is confirmed
Don't auto-provision trial servers until email is verified
Switch to UUIDs for user IDs - Makes enumeration much harder
Rate limit the registration endpoint - Currently unlimited
The 3 test accounts I created are user IDs 179, 180, and 181 - you may want to clean those up.
