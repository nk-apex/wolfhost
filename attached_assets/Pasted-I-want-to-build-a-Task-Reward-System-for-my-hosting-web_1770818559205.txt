I want to build a Task Reward System for my hosting website.

IMPORTANT:
Before generating the final code, ask me to provide the following links:

1. WhatsApp Channel link
2. WhatsApp Group link
3. Telegram Group link
4. YouTube Channel link

Do NOT hardcode placeholder links. Prompt me first for each link before generating the full implementation.

---------------------------------------

System Requirements:

• Users must be logged in to access the Tasks page.
• Display 4 tasks:
    - Follow WhatsApp Channel
    - Join WhatsApp Group
    - Join Telegram Group
    - Subscribe to YouTube Channel

• Each task should have:
    - A button to open the link in a new tab
    - A "Mark as Completed" button
    - A status indicator (Completed / Not Completed)

• Store task progress in the database linked to the logged-in user.
• Prevent the same task from being completed more than once.
• Show a progress counter like: 2/4 Tasks Completed.

---------------------------------------

Reward Logic:

• When ALL 4 tasks are completed:
    - Show a button: "Unlock My Free Server"
    - When clicked, automatically create a server in my Pterodactyl panel using the Application API.

• Use axios for API requests.
• Use the PANEL_API_KEY stored in environment variables.
• Do NOT expose API keys in frontend.

• After server creation:
    - Store the server ID in the database.
    - Prevent duplicate server creation.
    - Allow only ONE free server per user.

---------------------------------------

Security Requirements:

• Store user IP at signup.
• Allow only one free server per IP.
• Check if user already has a server before creating a new one.
• Add proper error handling.
• Log suspicious attempts.
• Do not allow multiple reward claims.

---------------------------------------

UI Requirements:

• Modern clean design.
• Show task progress visually.
• Show success message after server creation.
• Show error message if user already claimed reward.

---------------------------------------

Server Creation:

• Use predefined server resources (RAM, CPU, Disk).
• Use a predefined Node and Egg.
• Make the server name include the username.
• Ensure API request follows Pterodactyl Application API format.

---------------------------------------

Use clean backend structure.
Use proper async/await.
Add comments explaining important parts.
