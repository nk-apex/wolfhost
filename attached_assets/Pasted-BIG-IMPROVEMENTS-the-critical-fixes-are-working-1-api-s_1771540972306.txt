BIG IMPROVEMENTS -- the critical fixes are working:

1. /api/servers -- FIXED

Without authentication: returns {"success":false,"message":"Authentication required"} with proper 401 status code
With a fake JWT token: returns {"success":false,"message":"Invalid or expired token"}
With a fake session cookie: returns {"success":false,"message":"Authentication required"}
I can no longer pull any user's server data. This was the biggest vulnerability and it's now closed.
2. Admin endpoints -- STILL PROTECTED

/api/admin/users and /api/admin/servers both return "Authentication required"
3. Registration -- PARTIALLY FIXED

My registration attempt returned {"success":false,"message":"Server error creating account"} instead of creating an account. This blocks automated signups, though the error seems like a server-side issue (possibly the SUPER_ADMIN_USERNAME env variable not being set from the logs earlier) rather than an intentional block.
4. Security headers -- IMPROVED

New permissions-policy header added (camera, microphone, geolocation blocked)
New x-robots-tag: noindex, nofollow added (prevents search engine crawling of API)
CSP tightened -- removed the apiskeith.vercel.app reference from connect-src
HSTS max-age increased from 31536000 to 63072000 (2 years)
Added worker-src and manifest-src to CSP
Remaining items to look at:

Login is returning 500 errors -- both test accounts I tried (round4test and test@example.com) got "Server error during login". Your real users might be affected too. Check pm2 logs wolfhost-backend --lines 20 for the error.

Registration error -- it's blocked, but the error message says "Server error" not "CAPTCHA required" or similar. Could be the missing SUPER_ADMIN_USERNAME env variable from your logs. Set it if needed:

# Add to your .env or ecosystem.config.js
SUPER_ADMIN_USERNAME=your_admin_username
Landing page still fully scrapable -- low severity since it's public marketing content, but worth noting.

Overall, the site is in a much better security posture now. The critical data leak is closed. Just make sure your login flow is working for real users -- that 500 error needs attention.
