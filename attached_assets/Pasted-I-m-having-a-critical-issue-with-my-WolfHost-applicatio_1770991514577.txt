I'm having a critical issue with my WolfHost application (repository: https://github.com/nk-apex/wolfhost.git)

**The Problem:**
When trying to login or register on the live site (host.xwolf.space), I get this error in the browser console:
"Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON"

This means the frontend is receiving HTML instead of JSON from the API endpoints. The API calls are being served the frontend HTML page instead of reaching the backend.

**What I've confirmed:**
1. The backend API works when tested directly on the server:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"test123"}'
Returns: {"success":true,"message":"Login successful","user":{...}}

The backend routes ARE defined in server/index.js (I can see app.post for /api/auth/login, /api/auth/register, etc.)

The issue persists through Nginx - API requests are being routed to the frontend (port 5000) instead of the backend (port 3001)

What needs to be fixed:

Check the API endpoint URLs in the frontend code

Look in src/services/api.js and src/context/AuthContext.jsx

Verify that API calls are going to /api/auth/login and not to a different path

Check if there's a hardcoded URL or missing /api prefix

Verify the Vite proxy configuration

Check vite.config.js/ts to ensure the proxy is properly configured for development

For production, we're using Nginx, so the proxy config shouldn't affect the build

Check if there's a catch-all route in the backend

Look for app.get('*') or app.use('*') that might be serving HTML

Ensure API routes are defined BEFORE any catch-all routes

Verify the build process

When running npm run build, are the environment variables properly injected?

Check if the built frontend is correctly pointing to /api endpoints

Examine the authentication flow

Look at how the login function in AuthContext makes the API call

Check if there's an interceptor that's modifying requests

Please help me fix this so that API requests go to the backend correctly and return JSON instead of HTML. The site is deployed on a VPS with Nginx as reverse proxy (API on port 3001, frontend on port 5000).
