You are a senior cybersecurity engineer and full-stack security expert.

Audit my entire project and upgrade it to enterprise-grade security. This is a production hosting site where users purchase panels, so security must be extremely strict.

Apply the following security upgrades without breaking functionality:

🔐 1. Authentication & Authorization

Enforce strict role-based access control (RBAC)

Ensure admin routes are server-verified (not frontend-based)

Prevent privilege escalation

Protect against IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)

Add proper session validation

Expire sessions securely

Regenerate session tokens on login

🛡 2. Backend Security

Validate and sanitize all user inputs (server-side)

Add rate limiting to all sensitive routes (login, register, payment, panel creation)

Protect against:

SQL Injection

NoSQL Injection

XSS

CSRF

Command injection

Disable stack trace exposure in production

Hide internal error details from users

🔒 3. Payment & Panel Purchase Security

Verify payments server-side only

Prevent manual request manipulation

Prevent replay attacks

Ensure panel creation only happens after verified payment confirmation

Log all purchase actions

🚫 4. Anti-Bypass & Anti-Exploit

Prevent API abuse

Block direct access to internal routes

Protect against brute force login attempts

Add IP throttling

Implement bot protection logic

Add request integrity checks

🧱 5. Infrastructure Hardening

Use environment variables securely

Ensure secrets are never exposed in frontend

Add secure HTTP headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

Enable strict CORS configuration

Force HTTPS

📊 6. Monitoring & Logging

Log suspicious behavior

Log failed login attempts

Log admin activity

Add basic intrusion detection logic

🚨 7. Code Cleanup

Remove insecure patterns

Remove unused endpoints

Ensure production mode settings

Optimize security without reducing performance

After auditing:

List vulnerabilities found

Show exact code changes

Implement fixes directly

Explain what was improved

The goal is MAXIMUM SECURITY against hackers, bypassers, token manipulators, payment spoofers, and panel exploiters.

Treat this as a real fintech-level application.

🔥 EXTRA (Even More Powerful Version)

If you want it even more aggressive, add this at the bottom:

Assume attackers will:

Modify frontend JavaScript

Intercept API calls

Use Postman to forge requests

Inspect network traffic

Attempt role escalation

Reverse engineer logic

Try brute force and bot attacks

Secure the system against all of these.
